📊 HW_III Data Visualization Project
This project demonstrates a series of interactive and insightful visualizations created using the HW_III dataset. The aim is to explore different aspects of the data and communicate key insights through various chart types.

✅ Objectives
Load and understand the HW_III dataset.

Visualize key variables using interactive charts.

Provide multiple views into the data for exploratory analysis.

Combine all visualizations into a cohesive multiview dashboard.

📁 Files
HW_III.csv: The dataset used in the project.

visualizations.ipynb / index.html: Code or hosted visualizations (depending on your tool).

README.md: This file.

📌 Visualizations
1. 🍩 Donut Chart 
What: Displays the Rep and corresponding Total values.

Why: To compare the total values contributed by each representative.

2. 📈 Correlation View with Brush
What: Scatter plot showing correlation between Units and Unit Cost, with a Rectangular Brush to highlight individual Items.

Why: To explore how unit cost and quantity sold vary together, and to focus on specific items.

3. 🌊 Streamgraph
What: A streamgraph showing variation of Total over time, colored by Item.

Why: To visualize how the performance of each item has changed over time.

4. 📊 Histogram with Mean Overlay
What: Histogram of Units sold with a vertical line representing the global mean.

Why: To analyze the distribution of unit sales and spot outliers.

5. 🧪 Additional Visualizations
Two custom visualizations added to highlight other interesting aspects:

Bar Chart: Item vs. average Total to compare item performance.

Box Plot: Distribution of Unit Cost per Item to detect variability and outliers.

6. 🧩 Multiview Dashboard
What: A unified multiview combining all six visualizations in one interactive interface.

Why: To offer a comprehensive exploration tool for the HW_III dataset.
